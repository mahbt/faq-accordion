## My process

I started by analyzing the provided design and understanding the requirements for the FAQ accordion. Using the design as a guide, I built the HTML structure and styled it with CSS to match the given specifications. I then implemented JavaScript to add interactivity, allowing users to toggle FAQ answers and navigate using the keyboard. Throughout the development process, I tested the accordion across various devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness and accessibility. Finally, I deployed the project and verified that it met the design and functionality requirements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
